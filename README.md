## Spring Boot REST API 

This project consists of a simple REST API using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/), Spring Data JPA and Spring HATEOAS. It implements two entities and some methods such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

The code was written based on this [tutorial](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest/) with the help of the HATEOAS [Reference Document](https://docs.spring.io/spring-hateoas/docs/1.0.1.RELEASE/reference/html/).
